# Fork of React-Leaflet-Draw

This is a fork of [React-Leaflet-Draw](https://github.com/alex3165/react-leaflet-draw), a component that wraps [leaflet-draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) in order to work with [React-Leaflet](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet).

This fork is mainly to provide an alternative [MapControl](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/en/components.html#mapcontrol) component that more plainly wraps the Leafet.draw control and does not provide its own internal [FeatureGroup](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/en/components.html#featuregroup). I implemented this, as the existing control did not work well with the redux store I was using for state. It also provides a component that has its own internal FeatureGroup for convenience.

This repo will not be maintained (I really don't have the time). I provide it as a convenience and as a guide.

**NB:** If the original repo wants to incorporate these changes, that's fine by me, but I think that given the tradeoff between the size of this code and the potential to break the existing client code it is probably easier to just copy-paste this code if you need it (or use the `@andrewdodd/react-leaflet-draw` dep instead).

## Install

```
npm install @andrewdodd/react-leaflet-draw
```

## Getting started

First, include leaflet-draw styles in your project

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet.draw/1.0.3/leaflet.draw.css"/>
```

or by including

```
node_modules/leaflet-draw/dist/leaflet.draw.css
```
or perhaps forcing the css to be included (this one is for my own benefit, in case I forget!)

```
import 'leaflet-draw/dist/leaflet.draw.css'
```

As per the original React-Leaflet-Draw, it is important to wrap EditControl component in a FeatureGroup component from `react-leaflet`. However, interfacing to the EditControl component is complex enough that I have supplied a 'helper' container to do this. Have a look at the [example](https://github.com/andrewdodd/react-leaflet-draw/tree/master/example) for more info!

NB: The code for this repo is not very long, so I would recommend reading it to get a better feel for what is happening. However, in summary:

 - [EditControl](https://github.com/andrewdodd/react-leaflet-draw/blob/master/src/EditControl.js) - Acts as a go-between (an adapter) for the "React" way and the underlying Leaflet/Leaflet.draw way. It creates and manages the MapControl, it registers and unregisters from the Leaflet.draw events.
 - [EditControlFeatureGroup](https://github.com/andrewdodd/react-leaflet-draw/blob/master/src/FeatureGroup.js) - Combines both the necessary FeatureGroup and the LeafletDrawControl into a single component that manages the Leaflet.draw state changes, React-Leaflet child components and the underlying Leaflet.draw elements.

## Running the examples

There are a few examples in the repo, which show the various levels of complexity you need to deal with (and why this plugin is the way it is).

 1. Basic example - this just shows how to use the EditControlFeatureGroup in a map, but does not attempt to manage any state.
  
  * Run `npm run example-basic`
  * And go to http://localhost:8000

 2. Full example - this shows how to manage the various events coming out of the EditControlFeatureGroup, how to update your application state, and how to pass configuration through to the underlying leaflet.draw plugin.

  * Run `npm run example-full`
  * And go to http://localhost:8000
